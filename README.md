# wofi-screenshot
wofi script to capture the screen

the ```name``` flag sets the name with date + a random number at the end, you can change it
i set it that way to prevent file overwrite, but still not good for sorting

edit the ```outfile``` flag topoint to the place you want to save the images

I'm using dunstfy for notification, you can change if you don't use it or use something else

You need ```grim``` and ```slurp```
